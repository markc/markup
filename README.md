Markup README
=============

This project was going to be my attemtp at a modified and simpler
version of [Showdown], a Javascript port of the original perl based
[Markdown], but after a few days hacking I discovered [marked] which
is almost ideal for my needs and much easier to modify if need be. It
also included a single file HTML5/CSS3 MarkupTest page which provides
a simple editor and markup preview system that could be useful for
someone else so, FWIW, here it is.

The MarkupTest page provides a few interesting features:

-  a single self contained page, just wget index.html

-  example of including marked.js directly from it's Github repo

-  example live site taking advantage of Githubs gh-pages branch
