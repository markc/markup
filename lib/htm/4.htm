[Tasmania] is an Australian island and state. It is 240 kilometres
(150 mi) south of the continent, separated by Bass Strait. The
state includes the island of Tasmania, the 26th largest island in
the world, and the surrounding 334 islands. The state has a
population of 507,626 (as of June 2010), of whom almost half
reside in the greater Hobart precinct. Tasmania's area is 68,401
square kilometres (26,410 sq mi), of which the main island covers
62,409 square kilometres (24,096 sq mi).

Tasmania is promoted as the natural state, the "Island of
Inspiration", and A World Apart, Not A World Away owing to its
large and relatively unspoiled natural environment. Almost 37% of
Tasmania lies in reserves, national parks and World Heritage
Sites. The island is 364 kilometres (226 mi) long from its
northernmost to its southernmost points, and 306 kilometres (190
mi) from west to east.

The state capital and largest city is Hobart, which encompasses
the local government areas of City of Hobart, City of Glenorchy,
and City of Clarence, while the satellite town of Kingston (part
of the Municipality of Kingborough) is generally included in the
Greater Hobart area.

Other major population centres include Launceston in the north
and Devonport and Burnie in the northwest. The subantarctic
Macquarie Island is also under the administration of the state,
as part of the Huon Valley Council local government area.
