[New South Wales] (abbreviated as NSW) is a state of Australia,
located in the east of the country. It is bordered by Queensland,
Victoria and South Australia to the north, south and west
respectively. To the east, the state is bordered by the Tasman
Sea, which forms part of the Pacific Ocean. New South Wales
encompasses the whole of the Australian Capital Territory. The
state capital is Sydney, which is also the state's most populous
city. As of June 2010, the estimated population was 7,238,819,
which was 34.5% of the population of Australia, making it
Australia's most populous state. Inhabitants of New South Wales
are referred to as New South Welshmen.

The colony of New South Wales was founded in 1788 and originally
comprised much of the Australian mainland, as well as Van
Diemen's Land, Lord Howe Island and Norfolk Island, in addition
to the area currently referred to as the state of New South
Wales, which was formed during Federation in 1901. New Zealand
briefly became a part of New South Wales when it was annexed by
Britain in 1840.[3] During the 19th century, large areas were
successively separated to form the British colonies of Tasmania
(established as a separate colony named Van Diemen's Land in
1825), South Australia (1836), Victoria (1851) and Queensland
(1859).
