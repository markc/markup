[Western Australia] (commonly abbreviated as WA[a]) is a state of
Australia, occupying the entire western third of the Australian
continent. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean to the north and
west, the Great Australian Bight and Indian Ocean to the
south,[b] the Northern Territory to the north-east and South
Australia to the south-east. Western Australia is Australia's
largest state and the second-largest subnational entity in the
world. The state has approximately 2.3 million inhabitants
(around 10% of the national total), the majority of whom live in
the south-west corner of the state.

The first European to visit Western Australia was the Dutch
explorer Dirk Hartog, who visited the Western Australian coast in
1616. The British established a military outpost at King George
Sound, near present-day Albany, in 1826, which was followed by
the establishment of the Swan River Colony in 1829, including the
townsite of the present-day capital, Perth.

Western Australia achieved self-government in 1890, and later
federated with the other British colonies in Australia in 1901.
Today Western Australia's economy mainly relies on mining,
agriculture, and tourism, with the state supplying 46% of
Australia's exports. Western Australia is the third-largest
iron ore producer in the world.
