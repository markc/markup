[Victoria] is a state of Australia, in the south-east of the
country. Geographically the smallest mainland state, Victoria
is bordered by New South Wales, South Australia, and Tasmania on
Boundary Islet to the north, west and south respectively.

Victoria is Australia's most densely populated state, and has a
highly centralised population, with almost 75% of Victorians
living in Melbourne, the state capital and largest city.

Victoria, like Queensland, was named after Queen Victoria, the
monarch at the time.
