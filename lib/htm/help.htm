Markdown Help
=============

Paragraphs of text separated by blank lines are enclosed in `p`
tags but the underlying text remains with the original line
breaks. Click on this view area and use Ctrl-A and Ctrl-C to
copy this text then Ctrl-V in the editor to markup and render
this help text.

# h1 header tag
## h2 header tag
### h3 header tag
###### h6 header tag

*Italic text and * _more italic text_

**Bold text and ** __more Bold text__

*Italic **and** bold can be combined*

* Item 1 of an unordered list
* Item 2
  - Item 2a
  - Item 2b

*   **Item 3**

    If you indent extra paragraphs by 3 or 4 spaces then this
    text will be wrapped by `p` tags within the list item.

    Lists need something that starts at the begining of a new
    line to separate a list from whatever follows so we'll use
    a horizontal rule.

----

1. Item 1 of an ordered list
2. Item 2
    - Indented four spaces.
        + indented eight spaces.
    - Four spaces again.
3. Item 3
   * Item 3a
   * Item 3b

This plain http://google.com link is not marked up but this
inline [Google](http://google.com "Search The Web") link is. Here
is a reference-style link; [Check out GitHub][1] where the link
definition can be anywhere on the page but must be unique. If
there is no trailing link reference then the link tag itself can
be used for the reference, for example, [Youtube!] rocks. Links
and email addresses can also be enclosed in angle brackets to
provide simple inline markup.

  [Youtube!]: http://www.youtube.com/

> Blockquotes use traditional email style angle brackets and can
> **include markup**.

> > You can even have nested blockquotes.

This is an example of `inline code` using backticks.

    // Code is just text indented by 4 spaces
    // Any markdown text or HTML will remain untouched

    function hello(str) {
      return "**Hello** " + (str||"_World_");
    }

And finally, if you need to do something that Markdown can't
handle then you can always just use HTML, however, block element
begin and end tags cannot be indented and must be separated by
blank lines. Span-level HTML can include markup but any
block-level markup will be ignored.
