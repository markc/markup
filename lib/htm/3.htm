[South Australia] (abbreviated as SA) is a state of Australia,
located in the southern central part of the country. It covers
some of the most arid parts of the continent; with a total land
area of 983,482 square kilometres (379,725 sq mi), it is the
fourth largest of Australia's six states and two territories.

South Australia shares borders with all of the mainland states
and the Northern Territory. It is bordered to the west by Western
Australia, to the north by the Northern Territory, to the
north-east by Queensland, to the east by New South Wales, to the
south-east by Victoria, and to the south by the Great Australian
Bight and the Indian Ocean. With over 1.6 million people, the
state comprises less than 8% of the Australian population and
ranks fifth in population among the states and territories. The
majority of its people reside in the state capital, Adelaide,
with most of the remainder settled in fertile areas along the
south-eastern coast and River Murray. The state's origins are
unique in Australia as a freely settled, planned British
province, rather than as a convict settlement. Official
settlement began on 28 December 1836, when the colony was
proclaimed at The Old Gum Tree by Governor John Hindmarsh.

The first settlement to be established was Kingscote, Kangaroo
Island, on 26 July 1836, five months before Adelaide was founded.
The guiding principle behind settlement was that of systematic
colonisation, a theory espoused by Edward Gibbon Wakefield that
was later employed by the New Zealand Company. The aim was to
establish the province as a centre of civilisation for free
immigrants, promising civil liberties and religious tolerance.
Although its history is marked by economic hardship, South
Australia has remained politically innovative and culturally
vibrant. Today, the state is known as a state of festivals and of
fine wine. The state's economy centres on the agricultural,
manufacturing and mining industries and has an increasingly
significant finance sector as well.
