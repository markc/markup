[Queensland] is the second-largest and third-most populous state of
Australia, located in the northeast of the country. It is
bordered by the Northern Territory, South Australia and New South
Wales to the west, southwest and south respectively. To the east,
Queensland is bordered by the Coral Sea and Pacific Ocean.
Queensland has a population of 4,580,700, concentrated along the
coast and particularly in the state's South East. The state is
the world's sixth largest subnational entity, with an area of
1,852,642 km2. The capital and largest city in the state is
Brisbane, Australia's third largest city. Referred to as the
'Sunshine State', Queensland is home to 10 of Australia's 30
largest cities and is the nation's third largest economy.

Queensland was first occupied by Indigenous Australians and
Torres Strait Islanders, who arrived at least 40,000 years
ago. The first European to land in Queensland was Dutch
navigator Willem Janszoon in 1607. In 1770, Lieutenant James Cook
claimed the east coast of Australia for the Kingdom of Great
Britain. The colony of New South Wales was founded in 1788 by
Governor Arthur Phillip at Sydney; New South Wales at that time
included all of what is now Queensland, Victoria and Tasmania.
Queensland was explored in subsequent decades until the
establishment of a penal colony at Brisbane in 1824 by John
Oxley. Penal transportation ceased in 1839 and free settlement
permitted in 1842. Queensland was separated from New South Wales,
forming a self-governing colony, on 6 June 1859, a date now
celebrated state-wide as Queensland Day. Queensland achieved
statehood with the Federation of Australia on 1 January 1901.
