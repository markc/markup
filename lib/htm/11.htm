Welcome to my personal website where I'll highlight some of my projects
and vent some personal opinions on technical and social issues. This site
is hosted and managed via [GitHubs] incredible Git based project hosting
system which I think is arguably the third most important and useful
online facility after email and Google search. The site is based on
HTML5, CSS3 and some native non-jQuery Javascript for the expanding
section system. The source is freely available under a [AGPLv3] license
